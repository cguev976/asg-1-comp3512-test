// This file holds functions that are useful for dealing with movies.
// While in the first few milestones I am shoving you folks in a certain
// direction here, in later ones you'll have free reign to redesign things.


// TODO 1
//
// Create a variable/constant that holds an array consisting of the JavaScript
// objects given in JSON format in movie-data.json.


// TODO 2
//
// Create a constructor function called MovieCollection that takes in the
// array from TODO 1.
//
// Objects created from this constructor should have at least two methods:
//
//   1. all(), which returns an array of all the movies in the MovieCollection
//      object, sorted in alphabetic order
//
//   2. between(lowerYear, upperYear), which returns an array of all the
//      movies in the MovieCollection object released between lowerYear and
//      upperYear, inclusive on both ends. The resulting array should also be
//      sorted in alphabetic order.
//
// Both methods must use the appropriate array methods to implement the
// desired behaviour, and at least one arrow function must be used.


// TODO 3
//
// Create a MovieCollection variable/constant using your work from TODO 2.

// TODO 4
//
// Using the variable/constant from TODO 3, log to the console an array of all
// movies in the MovieCollection, sorted in alphabetic order.

// TODO 5
//
// Using the variable/constant from TODO 3, log to the console an array of all
// movies in the MovieCollection released between 1970 and 1980, sorted in 
// alphabetic order.
